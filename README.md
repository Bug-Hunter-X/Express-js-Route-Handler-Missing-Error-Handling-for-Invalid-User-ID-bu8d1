# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling when parsing user input.  The provided code attempts to fetch a user based on their ID, but it fails to handle cases where the ID is not a number, leading to unexpected behavior or application crashes.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected code with appropriate error handling.

## Bug

The original code attempts to parse the user ID as an integer without checking for potential errors.  If the ID is not a number, the `parseInt()` function will return `NaN`, which will cause the `users.find()` method to fail silently, possibly leading to unexpected behavior or application crashes.

## Solution

The solution adds explicit error handling using a `try...catch` block to catch potential errors during the parsing and retrieval of user data.  It includes comprehensive error handling to return appropriate HTTP status codes and informative error messages, improving the robustness and reliability of the application.
